Page 6, SECTION 3, ELECTIONS UNDER UNITED NATIONS AUSPICES, 20: The United Nations should be responsible for the organization and conduct of free and fair elections on the basis of genuine and verified voter registration lists of Cambodian citizens. Eligibility to vote, including provisions regarding the conditions of residence in Cambodia, will be established in the electoral regulations. Principles covering voting and candidate eligibility criteria will also be set out within the comprehensive political settlement. Special electoral arrangements should be agreed to guarantee the right to vote of Cambodian refugees and displaced persons.

Page 7, SECTION 3, ELECTIONS UNDER UNITED NATIONS AUSPICES, 23: A comprehensive political settlement must include a specified period within which elections will take place. The duration of the electoral process should be consistent with the above and as short as possible.

Page 7, SECTION 4, HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION, 24: Cambodia's tragic recent history requires special measures to assure protection of human rights.

Page 8, SECTION 4, HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION, 27.	In recognition of the need to promote respect for human rights in Cambodia and for all Cambodians, the comprehensive political settlement should include provisions under UN auspices to guarantee the following during the transitional period...

Page 8, SECTION 4, HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION, 29: As part of the comprehensive political settlement the other participating States should undertake to promote and encourage respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Cambodia as embodied in relevant international instruments so as to prevent the recurrence of human rights abuses.

The announcements made by the Irish Republican Army on 31 August 1994 and the Combined Loyalist Military Command on 13 October 1994 are a welcome response to the profound desire of people throughout these islands for a permanent end to the violence which caused such immense suffering and waste and served only to reinforce the barriers of fear and hatred, impeding the search for agreement.

Page 2, 7. 
In this Framework Document both Governments therefore describe a shared understanding reached between them on the parameters of a possible outcome to the Talks process, consistent with the Joint Declaration and the statement of 26 March 1991. Through this they hope to give impetus and direction to the process and to show that a fair and honourable accommodation can be envisaged across all the relationships, which would enable people to work constructively for their mutual benefit, without compromising the essential principles or the long-term aspirations or interests of either tradition or of either community.

Page 2, 9. 
The primary objective of both Governments in their approach to Northern Ireland is to promote and establish agreement among the people of the island of Ireland, building on the Joint Declaration. To this end they will both deploy their political resources with the aim of securing a new and comprehensive agreement involving the relevant political parties in Northern Ireland and commanding the widest possible support.

Page 2, 9. 
They take as guiding principles for their co-operation in search of this agreement: (i) the principle of self-determination, as set out in the Joint Declaration;...

Page 3, 12. 
...They will continue to work towards and encourage the achievement of agreement, so as to realise the goal set out in the statement of 26 March 1991 of ""a new beginning for relationships within Northern Ireland, within the island of Ireland and between the peoples of these islands"".

Page 4, Constitutional Issues, 17. 
New arrangements should be in accordance with the commitments in the Anglo-Irish Agreement and in the Joint Declaration. They should acknowledge that it would be wrong to make any change in the status of Northern Ireland save with the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland. If in future a majority of the people there wish for and formally consent to the establishment of a united Ireland, the two Governments will introduce and support legislation to give effect to that wish. 

Page 5, Constitutional Issues, 20.
...This new approach for Northern Ireland, based on the continuing willingness to accept the will of a majority of the people there, will be enshrined in British constitutional legislation embodying the principles and commitments in the Joint Declaration and this Framework Document, either by amendment of the Government of Ireland Act 1920 or by its replacement by appropriate new legislation, and appropriate new provisions entrenched by agreement.

Page 11, East-West Structures, 42.
...The Conference will be the principal instrument for an intensification of the co-operation and partnership between both Governments, with particular reference to the principles contained in the Joint Declaration, in this Framework Document and in the new Agreement, on a wide range of issues concerned with Northern Ireland and with the
relations between the two parts of the island of Ireland. It will facilitate the promotion of lasting peace, stability, justice and reconciliation among the people of the island of Ireland and maintenance of effective security co-operation between the two Governments.",GBR,IRL,200,205,315,,,,No,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

On 9 April, 1995, in the rural “ejido” of San Miguel in Ocosingo Municipality, the federal government and EZLN began a process of dialogue and negotiation based on the desire of the parties to reach a peaceful, just and dignified solution to the conflict which began on 1 January 1994, within the framework of the Law on Dialogue, Accord and dignified Peacemaking in Chiapas, where the National Intermediation Commission (proceeding in a constant active and operational effort of neutralisation) is acting as mediator, and where the Accord and Peacemaking Commission (set up to collaborate, help and participate in the dialogue and negotiation) plays a supporting role.
In accordance with the principles adopted in the San Miguel Declaration, the parties have agreed:

Page 1, 
1. To adopt the following agenda for the dialogue and negotiation. In implementing the six points of article 2 of the Law, which defines the objective of the Agreement for Accord and Peacemaking in Justice and Dignity, this negotiation should result in effective solutions, responses and engagements with the political, economic, social and cultural causes of the conflict.

Page 1, 
1.1 General Agenda (including the following themes)
a) Full détente, which refers to the adoption of détente measures likely to eliminate the conditions for a resumption of hostilities and to lead to the conclusion of the Agreement of accord and peacemaking in justice and dignity. Accord and Peacemaking

Page 2, 
1.1 General Agenda (including the following themes)
... b) Political, economic, social and cultural themes, which will be addressed:
... - d) EZLN political and social participation, in accordance with the Law on Dialogue, Accord and dignified Peace in Chiapas.

Page 2,
1.3 The themes addressed at the level of the State of Chiapas will ultimately lead to actual commitments made by the two parties, concerning the political, economic, social and cultural causes of the conflict; these commitments will be included in the Agreement for Accord and Peacemaking in Justice and Dignity.

Page 2,
1.4 The Agreements of national scope which may be produced during negotiations on the themes and sub-themes, will ultimately result in the joint development of common proposals, which the parties will undertake to submit for debate and decision at the national level, and will be included as such in the Agreement for Accord and Peacemaking in Justice and Dignity.

Page 2,
1.5 The sub-themes of national scope will be the subject of a dialogue between the parties. Where possible the parties will develop common positions which they will undertake to submit for debate and decision at the national level, and will be included as such in the Agreement for Accord and Peacemaking in Justice and Dignity. Where common positions cannot be developed, the parties may publish their positions separately.

Page 2,
3. The Agreement for Accord and Peacemaking in Justice and Dignity will be accompanied by a supplementary protocol for conciliation. If the parties agree, the different Chiapas social groups may subscribe to and adhere to the protocol.

Page 3, 
4.1 The plenary assembly
... g) The dialogue process will be based on the principle of partial simultaneity and periodic continuity. At the end, the parties will accept the commitments into which they have entered, which should appear in the Agreement for Accord and Peacemaking in Justice and Dignity, as well as, if necessary, joint proposals that the parties undertake to address to the authorities for debate and decision, and which would appear as such in the Agreement for Accord and Peacemaking in Justice and Dignity.

Add to Article 29 the following sections: 7.1°. The State may consent to be bound by the British-Irish Agreement done at Belfast on the 10th day of April 1998, hereinafter called the Agreement.

Page 14, STRAND TWO, NORTH/SOUTH MINISTERIAL COUNCIL, 10. 
The two Governments will make necessary legislative and other enabling preparations to ensure, as an absolute commitment, that these bodies, which have been agreed as a result of the work programme, function at the time of the inception of the British-Irish Agreement and the transfer of powers, with legislative authority for these bodies transferred to the Assembly as soon as possible thereafter. Other arrangements for the agreed co-operation will also commence contemporaneously with the transfer of powers to the Assembly.

Page 17, STRAND TWO, BRITISH-IRISH INTERGOVERNMENTAL CONFERENCE, 1.
There will be a new British-Irish Agreement dealing with the totality of relationships. It will establish a standing British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, which will subsume both the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Council and the Intergovernmental Conference established under the 1985 Agreement.

Page 17, STRAND TWO, BRITISH-IRISH INTERGOVERNMENTAL CONFERENCE, 9. 
The Conference will keep under review the workings of the new British-Irish Agreement and the machinery and institutions established under it, including a formal published review three years after the Agreement comes into effect. Representatives of the Northern Ireland Administration will be invited to express views to the Conference in this context. The Conference will contribute as appropriate to any review of the overall political agreement arising from the multi-party negotiations but will have no power to override the democratic arrangements set up by this Agreement.

...The meeting comes against a backdrop of non-implementation of key provisions of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), more especially the conduct of free and fair general elections, holding of referendum on self-determination for the people of Southern Sudan to either confirm unity of Sudan or opt for separation and holding of Abyei referendum on whether Abyei retains its special administrative status in the North or be part of Bahr el Ghazal. The meeting also comes as the simmering crisis in Darfur is intensifying. This underscores the need for extensive dialogue without prior conditions or exclusion of any party with a view to addressing the national crisis Sudan currently faces.

Page 3, PREAMBLE 
...The aim is to ensure full implementation of all peace agreements and all constitutional arrangements prescribed in the Interim National Constitution (INC), 2005; including respect for human rights and the rule of law, political empowerment of women, conduct of free and fair elections, holding of referendum for the people of Southern Sudan and popular consultation for Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile States. The commitment to resolve the conflict in Darfur is duly emphasized.

Page 3, PREAMBLE 
...The Leadership Council met on September 26 to adopt the APPC’s agenda and to draw up a set of rules to govern proceedings. The general assembly met on September 27 and listened to keynote speech by the Chairman of SPLM and opening remarks by leaders of 28 political parties and 5 civil society organizations, in addition to an address by a delegation from the Peoples’ Front for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ) of Eritrea. On September 28, the APPC set up 5 working committees to discuss key national issues, namely implementation of all peace agreements, democratic transformation, national reconciliation and healing, economic and social situation in addition to foreign policy.

Page 4, 1. DIALOGUE AND NATIONAL CONSENSUS 
1.1. The APPC maintains that the process of forging national consensus requires open dialogue without prior conditions or exclusion of any party. The APPC in Juba is the first such process since the signing of all peace agreements, particularly the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA). There is need to continue this free democratic dialogue among all national forces, civil society and women organizations.

Page 4, 2. NATIONAL RECONCILIATION
2.3. The APPC maintains that achieving the objective referred to in Paragraph 2.2 above demand full implementation of outstanding key provisions of the CPA, more especially the provisions related to democratic transformation.

Page 5, 3. PEACE AGREEMENTS
3.1. Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) 
3.1.1. Reaffirms commitment to full implementation of CPA which is essential to sustainable peace and confidence building between the North and South Sudan. In this regard, the APPC resolves the following: 
3.1.1.1. Holding of referendum on self-determination within the period stipulated in the CPA and Interim National Constitution (INC), 2005; 
3.1.1.2. Enactment of Referendum Bill during the prorogation of the current National Assembly, with simple majority vote (50%+1) being threshold for either confirming unity of Sudan or opting for secession and providing for all Southern Sudanese to take part in this process; and 
3.1.1.3. Demarcation of North-South borders prior to the holding of general elections. 
3.1.2. Emphasizes the importance of bringing all laws in consonance with the INC, 2005 
3.1.5. Adhering to the CPA provisions on making unity attractive, the APPC decides to set up a working group focused on developing political, economic and cultural programs to promote unity during the remainder of the Interim Period while at the same time guaranteeing respect for separation in the event the people of Southern Sudan opt for it.

Page 6, 3.2 DARFUR CONFLICT 
3.2.1. Urges the full implementation of Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA), particularly the powersharing, wealth-sharing and security provisions. 
3.2.9. Calls for the holding of the Darfur-Darfur dialogue conference with the participation of all stakeholders with the view to sorting out Darfuri internal relations and repairing the social fabric destroyed by the civil war. The conference shall be guided by agreed Declaration of Principles (DOP), resulting in comprehensive agreement that shall be acceptable to all Darfurians and endorsed nationally by an all-party conference.

Page 7, 3. PEACE AGREEMENTS, 3.3. Eastern Sudan Peace Agreement (ESPA) 
3.3.1. The APPC reaffirms its commitment to full implementation of ESPA and to the lifting of state of emergency. 
3.3.2. The APPC further reiterates its commitment to address the shortcomings of ESPA through the undertaking of complementary political, developmental and remedial measures to resolve the underlying grievances of the people of Eastern Sudan.

Page 7, 3. PEACE AGREEMENTS, 3.4. Cairo Peace Agreement

6.1.1. Ensuring respect for international conventions; 

Page 9, 7. THE WAY FORWARD 
7.4. The APPC maintains that Juba Declaration shall be subject to periodic review, particularly in relation to democratic transformation, elections, holding of referendum on self-determination for the people of Southern Sudan, implementation of Abyei Protocol and holding of popular consultation for the people of Blue Nile and South Kordofan States, in addition to finding a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in Darfur.",SDN,,625,,309,,,,No,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Dukana-Dillo-Maikona peace declaration was first support by the Kenya National Steering Committee (NSC) in 20009.  The declaration was a cross border solutions to the prolonged community conflict between Boranas of Ethiopia and Gabras of Kenya.  As a result of this declaration, the conflict was mitigated to a great extend enabling the two communities live together, share grazing and watering resources , opened cross border trade and enabled education and health services sharing especially on the Kenyan side.  However, with the introduction of a USAID funded program dabbed PEACE III, in partnership with Strategies for Northern Development (SND) and Inter African Group (AIG), the two communities identified the need to revise the declaration and its amendment due to the prevailing circumstances identified as inconsistencies, ambiguity and double punishment inflicted on suspect.  The parties, in one of PEACE III activities suggested the need to review some key clauses such as age specification of cattle that is used for blood compensation.  On May 31, 2017 at Koet-Borana Hotel Moyale- Ethiopia, PEACE III and its partners facilitated a community meeting that reviewed and mended the Dukana-Dillo-Maikona Declaration. This meeting gave forth the reviews and amendments on the Dukana-Dillo-Maikona declaration peace process which PEACE III helped document and is here presented for validation.",KEN,ETH,501,530,NA,NA,NA,NA,No,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Recalling that the ARCSSS provided for the establishment of a Ceasefire and Transitional Security Arrangements Monitoring Mechanism (CTSAMM) to monitor the processes of the Permanent Ceasefire, and that the Mechanism has already been operationalized;

Considering the need for effective monitoring of the CoH Agreement, by a mechanism in which all the signatories of the Agreement can participate and through which they can be held accountable;

Recognising that the CTSAMM can play a critical role in monitoring the 'CoH Agreement, and in promoting the full implementation of that Agreement, and fostering confidence in the Parties;

The Parties Agree as follows:

Today, the governments of the United Kingdom, Norway and the United States (the Troika) signed the Juba Peace Agreement as Witnesses in a signal of political support to the Agreement. Having welcomed the Agreement in October 2020, this further step demonstrates our commitment to the success of the Agreement and its potential to help meet the calls of the Sudanese people for freedom, peace, and justice, including for those affected by conflict in Darfur, South Kordofan and Blue Nile states, as well as other historically marginalised parts of Sudan. We urge immediate steps to fully implement and adhere to the agreed timelines set forth in the transitional Constitutional Document and the Juba Peace Agreement, including the formation of key institutions such as the Transitional Legislative Council.

... UNITAMS plays a key role in supporting implementation of the Juba Peace Agreement.

... The Troika also welcomes the agreement on a Declaration of Principles between the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-North/Abdelaziz alHilu and encourages both sides to reach agreement on ending their conflict so all Sudanese can play a part in the transitional process.

Page 2, Troika statement from the UK, Norway and USA:
We also continue to make our call for the Sudan Liberation Movement/ Abdulwahid al-Nur to begin talks as part of achieving a comprehensive peace involving all major armed movements. The Government of Sudan has described the Juba Peace Agreement as ‘Phase One’ of the peace process and the negotiations with al-Hilu and al-Nur as ‘Phase Two’.
