Analyzed from the viewpoint of indigenous women from Chiapas, the problem of rights demands an end to silent voices and secular oblivion. To do away with the latter it is necessary to act on both national as well as State legislation in order to guarantee their fundamental rights as human beings and as indigenous people.

Compliance with the international pacts and conventions which have been entered into by the Mexican government. Of particular importance here is Convention 169 of the ILO, the Vienna Declaration on Human Rights referring to the elimination of any form of discrimination against women, and the Agreement of the World Conference on Population and Development referring to the health and reproductive rights of women as long as these do not contravene the basic principles of the General Constitution of the Republic.

It is proposed that the Congress of the Union should recognize, in the constitutional and political amendments they reach, the right of indigenous women to participate, on an equal footing with men, at all levels of government as well as in the development of the indigenous peoples.

Page 4, II, 6. 
It is proposed that the Congress of the Union and the legislatures of the nation’s states, in recognition of indigenous autonomy and for the determination of its levels, should take into consideration the main rights enshrined therein, with the establishment of the mechanisms needed to ensure their free exercise. Said rights include, primarily, the following: 
... 
b) obtaining recognition for their internal systems of governance as they apply to regulation and punishment, provided they do not infringe constitutional guarantees or human rights, particularly those applicable to women;

Page 7, III, 5.
The satisfaction of basic needs. The State must promote mechanisms to guarantee indigenous peoples conditions that will allow them to take satisfactory charge of their food, health, housing, and, at the very least, an adequate level of well-being. Social policy must promote priority programs to improve health and nutritional standards among the children of indigenous peoples; it must also support, on an egalitarian basis, the training of women, expanding their participation in the organization and development of the family and the community. Priority must be given to the involvement of indigenous women in decisions regarding projects for economic, political, social, and cultural development.

Page 8, III, 7. 
Protection for indigenous migrants. The State must promote specific social policies to protect indigenous migrants, both within the nation’s borders and beyond them, with inter-institutional actions to support women’s education and work and children’s and young people’s health and education; in rural areas, these policies must coordinate between the zones that provide agricultural laborers and those that make use of them.

B.  Participation of women in economic and social development

11. The active participation of women is essential for Guatemala’s economic and social development, and the State has a duty to promote the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women.

12. Recognizing women’s undervalued contributions in all spheres of economic and social activity, and particularly their efforts towards community improvement, the Parties agree that there is a need to strengthen women’s participation in economic and social development on equal terms.

13. To this end, the Government undertakes to take the specific economic and social situation of women into account in its development strategies, plans and programmes, and to train civil servants in analysis and planning based on this approach.  This undertaking includes the following:

(a) Recognizing the equal rights of women and men in the home, in the workplace, in the production sector and in social and political life, and ensuring that women have the same opportunities as men, particularly with regard to access to credit, land ownership and other productive and 
technological resources;

Education and training
(b) Ensuring that women have equal opportunities for education and training in the same conditions as men, and that any form of discrimination against women that may be found in school curricula is eliminated;

Housing

(c) Ensuring that women have equal access to housing of their own by eliminating the obstacles and 
impediments that affect women in relation to rental property, credit and construction;

Health

(d) Implementing nationwide comprehensive health programmes for women, which involves giving women 
access to appropriate information, prevention and health care services;

Labour

(e)  Guaranteeing women’s right to work, which requires:

(i)  Using various means to encourage vocational training for women;

(ii) Revising labour legislation to guarantee equality of rights and opportunities between men and women;

(iii) In rural areas, recognizing women as agricultural workers to ensure that their work is valued and remunerated;

(iv) Enacting laws to protect the rights of women who work as household employees, especially in relation to fair wages, working hours, social security and respect for their dignity;

Organization and participation

(f) Guaranteeing women’s right to organize and their participation, on the same terms as men, at the senior decision-making levels of local, regional and national institutions;

(g)  Promoting women’s participation in public administration, especially in the formulation, execution and supervision of government plans and policies;

Legislation

(h)  Revising national legislation and regulations to eliminate all forms of discrimination against women in terms of economic, social, cultural and political participation, and to give effect to the government commitments deriving from the ratification of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women

Page 10, Annex, II. SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT, A. Education and training
21. Education and training have a fundamental role in the country’s economic, cultural, social and political development. They are central to the strategy of
equity and national unity, and vital for economic modernization and international competitiveness. Reform of the educational system and of its administration is therefore necessary, as is the implementation of coherent and forceful State policies in the field of education, in order to achieve the following objectives:
... (b) To avoid the perpetuation of poverty and of social, ethnic, sexual and geographical forms of discrimination, particularly those which arise from the divide between urban and rural society;

Page 13, Annex, II. SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT, B. Health
23. The Parties agree on the need to promote a reform of the national health sector. This reform should be aimed at ensuring effective exercise of the fundamental right to health, without any discrimination whatsoever, and the effective performance by the State, which would be provided with the necessary resources, of its obligation with regard to health and social welfare. Some of the main points of this reform are as follows:
... Priority care
(d) The system would give priority to efforts to fight malnutrition and to promote environmental sanitation, preventive health care and primary health care, especially maternal and child care. The Government undertakes to allocate at least 50 per cent of public health expenditure to preventive care and undertakes to cut the 1995 infant and maternal mortality rate in half by the year 2000. In addition, the Government undertakes to maintain the certification of eradication of poliomyelitis, and to eradicate measles by the year 2000;

Some of the main points of this reform are as follows:
... Social participation
(g) The system would encourage active participation of municipalities, communities and social organizations (including groups of women, indigenous people, trade unions and civic and humanitarian associations) in the planning, execution and monitoring of the administration of health services and programmes,

Page 14, Annex, II. SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT, C. Social security
24. Social security is a mechanism for expressing human solidarity and promoting the common good, laying the foundations for stability, economic development, national unity and peace. Under the Political Constitution of the Republic, the Guatemalan Social Security Institute, an autonomous body, administers the social security system. The Parties consider that appropriate measures should be taken to expand its coverage and increase its benefits and the quality and efficiency of its services. To that end, the following should be taken into account:
... (b) Under the International Labour Organization convention ratified by Guatemala, social security should include programmes for medical care and benefits in the areas of sickness, maternity, disability, old age, survival, job-related accidents and illnesses, employment and family welfare;

Page 16, Annex, II. SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT, E. Work
26. Work is essential for the integral development of the individual, the wellbeing of the family and the social and economic development of Guatemala. Labour relations are an essential element of social participation in socioeconomic development and of economic efficiency. In this respect, the State’s policy with regard to work is critical for a strategy of growth with social justice. In order to carry out this policy, the Government undertakes to:
... Protective labour legislation
(d) Decentralize and expand labour inspection services, strengthening the capacity to monitor compliance with the labour norms of domestic law and those derived from the international labour agreements ratified by Guatemala, paying particular attention to monitoring compliance with the labour rights of women, migrant and temporary agricultural workers, household workers, minors, the elderly, the disabled and other workers who are in a more vulnerable and
unprotected situation;

Page 13-14, Annex, II. SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT, B. Health
23. The Parties agree on the need to promote a reform of the national health sector. This reform should be aimed at ensuring effective exercise of the fundamental right to health, without any discrimination whatsoever, and the effective performance by the State, which would be provided with the necessary resources, of its obligation with regard to health and social welfare. Some of the main points of this reform are as follows:
... Social participation
(g) The system would encourage active participation of municipalities, communities and social organizations (including groups of women, indigenous people, trade unions and civic and humanitarian associations) in the planning, execution and monitoring of the administration of health services and programmes, through local health systems and urban and rural development councils;

Page 19, Annex, III. AGRARIAN SITUATION AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT, A. Participation
33. The capacity of all actors involved in the agricultural sector must be mobilized to make proposals and to take action, including indigenous peoples’ organizations, producers’ associations, business associations, rural workers’ trade unions, rural and women’s organizations or universities and research centres in Guatemala. To that end, in addition to the provisions of other chapters of this Agreement, the Government undertakes to:
(a) Strengthen the capacity of rural organizations such as associative rural enterprises, cooperatives, small farmers’ associations, mixed enterprises and self-managed and family businesses to participate fully in decisions on all matters concerning them and to establish or strengthen State institutions, especially those of the State agricultural sector, involved in rural development so that they can promote such participation, particularly the full participation of women in the decision-making process. That will strengthen the effectiveness of State action and ensure that it responds to the needs of rural areas. In particular, participation in development councils will be promoted as a framework for the joint formulation of development and land use plans;
(b) Strengthen and expand the participation of tenant farmers’ organizations, rural women, indigenous organizations, cooperatives, producers’ trade unions and non-governmental organizations in the National Agricultural Development Council as the main mechanism for consultation, coordination and social participation in the decision-making process for rural development, and in particular for the implementation of this chapter."

The new beginning in policing envisaged by the Agreement, requires, amongst other things, all community leaders, including political party leaders and local councillors, to take steps to remove all discouragements to members of the community from supporting and applying to join the police, and making it a priority to encourage them to apply. Part of this process would involve Sinn Féin deciding to join the Policing Board and the District Policing Partnerships. In recognition of the importance of policing with the support of the community, the PSNI will renew and continue its efforts to encourage applications from all parts of the community, including those in which the service has traditionally been under-represented. Efforts should be made to encourage recruitment from women and ethnic minorities.

In the Agreement, the parties affirmed their commitment to the mutual respect, the civil rights and the religious liberties of everyone in the community, and affirmed in particular:...• the right to equal opportunity in all social and economic activity, regardless of class, creed, disability, gender or ethnicity;...• the right of women to full and equal political participation.

STRESSING the disastrous situation on the health level characterised by the insufficiency, dilapidation or destruction of infrastructures, the lack or insufficiency of medicines and equipment, the high and uncontrolled costs of care, the recurrence of endemic and epidemic diseases, the re-emergence of previously controlled diseases, the high prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases and of HIV/AIDS, the high rate of infant and maternal mortality and malnutrition and the uneven distribution of health professionals between rural and urban environments as well as their demotivation; 
[...]
CONCERNED by the fact that all cardinal virtues in the social sector have been compromised by the armed conflict resulting in the destabilisation of homes, the separation or divorce of parents, the increase in the number of abandoned children, children born out of wedlock, young delinquents and illiterates; and resulting further in: prostitution, promiscuity, an increase in the number of women as heads of households and child-mothers, the negation of moral and ethical values (rape, incest, pedophilia, abuse of women, etc), children being involved in odd jobs for survival, the abandonment of the elderly and those living with a physical or mental handicap, the neglect of war invalids and prisoners etc; 
NOTING that the armed conflict has increased discrimination against women thus violating the universal principle of equal rights and respect for human dignity, rendering women more vulnerable, hampering their equal participation in the political, social, economic and cultural life of their country and restraining women from serving their country and humankind to their fullest potential; 
REALISING that the situation of women in rural areas has become increasingly　precarious and dangerous, and that it is essential for them to be given more　consideration at the policy design stage, particularly taking into account their specific　needs and their significant economic role; and that the development of the country　and the cause for peace require maximal participation of women on an equal footing　with men in all fields;
OBSERVING the corruption of the youth and the uprooting of young Congolese　people, whilst there is no real policy for their guidance and supervision, and young　people are cast out and left to their own devices, reduced to vagrancy, exposed to drug addiction, criminality and disease (tuberculosis, AIDS, STDs, etc);
[...]
OBSERVING the growing numbers of the socially maladjusted, the increasing pauperisation of the population, especially women and households more and more frequently headed by women, the chronic non-payment of salaries, the excessive material burden borne by women and its impact on their morale, and all the situations accentuating the increased unemployment rate;

[...]
CONCERNED by the humanitarian crisis in the DRC, which has reached catastrophic proportions, directly or indirectly affecting more than 20 000 000 people as a result of destruction of infrastructures, lack of access to medical care, schooling and drinking water, malnutrition, spread of HIV/AIDS and STDs, malaria, TB and an increase in an already high unemployment rate (50% of the population);
[...]
STATING that the above conditions have directly or indirectly affected the entire Congolese population to different degrees, giving rise to the following vulnerable groups:
1. more than 3 million internally displaced people, who have fled their war-ravaged, insecure towns or villages, losing everything: houses, jobs, source of income, and become completely destitute and reduced to vagrancy. A large number of these people are women, children and the elderly, most of whom are malnourished and in need of health care; 
[...]
3. women, children, the elderly or the handicapped exposed to the horrors of war, psychological trauma and sexually transmitted diseases, eg HIV/AIDS;

[...]
CONSIDERING that one of the essential missions of a State is the protection of its citizens by guaranteeing their security, the exercise of their fundamental rights and their socio-economic welfare in conformity with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on 1948, the African Charter of Human and People’s Rights of 1981, the clauses relating to women’s and children’s rights and all international legal instruments relating to the rights of refugees.

Page 72, 27. Resolution No: DIC/CHSC/07 RELATING TO ETHICS AND THE FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION:
[...]
GIVEN that at the heart of this crisis corruption in many forms appears as the manifestation of the anti-values and non-transparent practices on the part of men and women seeking to advance their careers in executive spheres, eg the army, the police, information services, public administration, health, education, the economy, religious denominations, the legal system, family and civil society, and shows itself in despicable behaviour such as lying, malevolence, defamation, fraud, malpractice, misappropriation, influence peddling, nepotism, favouritism, tribalism, regionalism, clientelism, sexual harassment, bribery, the abuse of power, forgery and
deceitfulness, etc;

Page 74-76, 28. Resolution No: DIC/CHSC/08 RELATING TO THE NATIONAL MONITORING BODY FOR HUMAN RIGHTS:
RECALLING that this state of affairs led to the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on 10 December 1948 to promote and ensure the protection of human rights and that, since then, other conventions have been added to this instrument, namely:

[…]
i. strive towards the production of broadcasts, programmes and educational documentaries which respect human values, especially the dignity of women and young people.

Page 82-83, 31. Resolution No: DIC/CPR/02 ON THE PROTECTION OF MINORITIES:

The Conference encourages the Government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE to enter into discussions as early as possible on a provisional administrative structure to manage the reconstruction and development aspects of the transition process. The process would need the expeditious development of a roadmap with clear milestones indicating the path towards a mutually acceptable final political solution. With this in view, the international community intends to review and monitor the progress of the peace process closely, with particular reference to objectives and milestones including:
... g. Effective inclusion of gender equity and equality in the peace building, the conflict transformation and the reconstruction process, emphasizing an equitable representation of women in political fora and at other decision-making levels."

[...]
All Algerian men and women are absolutely convinced that no political, social or economic development will bring the benefits they hope for, without a return to peace and security. Having been deprived, for a time, of this peace and security, they appreciate how important it is, for each and every one of them and for the nation itself. A new approach is now needed for a definitive return to peace and security based on national reconciliation, because it is only through national reconciliation that we can heal the wounds caused by this national tragedy. The Algerian people genuinely desire national reconciliation. And this desire is all the more acute given the many developmental challenges Algeria now faces. The Algerian people are convinced that in national reconciliation lies hope and the chance to consolidate all the advantages of a democratic and republican Algeria, to the great benefit of all of its citizens. 

Page 3, II. MEASURES DESIGNED TO CONSOLIDATE PEACE

Acknowledging God’s right over us, and in fulfillment of the call of our homeland and citizens, and in a response to the call of our religious and national leaderships and the determination of our great authorities and of our leaders and politicians, and in the midst of international support from our friends and those who love us, marched for the first time in our history towards the ballot boxes by the millions, men and women, young and old, on the thirtieth of January 2005, invoking the pains of sectarian oppression inflicted by the autocratic clique and inspired by the tragedies of Iraq’s martyrs, Shiite and Sunni, Arabs and Kurds and Turkmen and from all other components of the people, and recollecting the darkness of the ravage of the holy cities and the South in the Sha’abaniyya uprising and burnt by the flames of grief of the mass graves, the marshes, Al-Dujail and others and articulating the sufferings of racial oppression in the massacres of Halabcha, Barzan, Anfal and the Fayli Kurds and inspired by the ordeals of the Turkmen in Bashir and the sufferings of the people of the western region, as is the case in the remaining areas of Iraq where the people suffered from the liquidation of their leaders, symbols, and Sheiks and from the displacement of their skilled individuals and from drying out of its cultural and intellectual wells, so we sought hand in hand and shoulder to shoulder to create our new Iraq, the Iraq of the future, free from sectarianism, racism, complex of regional attachment, discrimination, and exclusion.

...We, the people of Iraq, who have just risen from our stumble, and who are looking with confidence to the future through a republican, federal, democratic, pluralistic system, have resolved with the determination of our men, women, elderly, and youth to respect the rule of law, to establish justice and equality, to cast aside the politics of aggression, to pay attention to women and their rights, the elderly and their concerns, and children and their affairs, to spread the culture of diversity, and to defuse terrorism.

People of Afghanistan demand a just peace which can guarantee the rights of its all citizens including women and children. For the purpose of social justice, the Jirga urges that laws be applied equally on all citizens of the country

Page 4, Developing Mechanism for Negotiation with the Disaffected, 12
We, the participants of the Jirga commit ourselves to act as messengers of peace and take the message of the Jirga to our communities and our people in our areas and to cooperate with the local authorities, tribal elders, youth and the women for the objective of ensuring peace."
709,"Page 2, Preamble, 5
The Kabul Process recognises that the Afghan Government can guarantee security only when its people are confident in its ability to deliver public services, good governance, human rights protection including gender equality, and economic opportunities. All parties recognise that the chance to deliver on these commitments has been earned through tragic losses, including civilian casualties, and the tremendous sacrifices of the Afghan and international armed forces currently engaged in the struggle for peace and stability in Afghanistan.

Page 5, Gender and Children’s Rights, 10
Participants reiterated the centrality of women's rights, including political, economic and social equality, to the future of Afghanistan, as enshrined in the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. Participants commended the mainstreaming of gender into all priority programmes and reiterated their commitment to assist all national ministries and sub-national government bodies in implementing their respective responsibilities under the National Action Plan for the Women of Afghanistan (NAPWA), and to ensure that all training and civic education programmes contribute to concrete advancements in its implementation. In addition, the Government of Afghanistan, over the next six months, is to identify and prioritize NAPWA benchmarks for implementation within each cluster; and develop a strategy to implement the Elimination of Violence Against Women Law (EVAW), including services for victims. Participants committed to respect and prioritise the fulfilment of the rights of Afghan children, and to invest in girls’ and boys’ education, protection and healthcare.

Page 6, Peace, Reconciliation and Reintegration, 13
Participants welcomed the outcomes of the Consultative Peace Jirga, held from 2-4 June 2010. The Consultative Peace Jirga demonstrated the strong will within Afghan society to reconcile their differences politically in order to end the conflict. The Government of Afghanistan noted the demand of the Consultative Peace Jirga that all parties engaged in the conflict respect the need to bring lasting peace through mutual understanding and negotiations, in full respect of the values and rights, including those of Afghanistan’s women, enshrined in Afghanistan's Constitution, and through inclusive elections. Participants welcomed the establishment of an inclusive High Peace Council composed of women and men to set policy, strengthen political confidence and build consensus.

Page 6, Peace, Reconciliation and Reintegration, 14
Accordingly, Participants welcomed and endorsed in principle the Afghan Government's Peace and Reintegration Programme, which is open to all Afghan members of the armed opposition and their communities who renounce violence, have no links to international terrorist organizations, respect the Constitution and are willing to join in building a peaceful Afghanistan. The international community reiterated its commitment to continue to support this endeavor through the Peace and Reintegration Trust Fund, and looks forward to local Peace Jirga meetings that include men and women at district and provincial levels to discuss elements of an enduring peace.

Page 9, Next Steps: Supporting Afghan Ownership and Leadership, Strengthening International Partnership, 31

Delegates did not reach consensus on a number of further suggestions, such as limiting the term for ministers and head of government or a fixed quota for women in parliament. They did not agree on whether the Shura Council should be granted the same powers as the Parliament, and whether the responsibility for law making and oversight should be restricted to the elected chamber.

Page 2, 2.  The debate centred on equal representation of the population. Critics of the current system argued that the geographical distribution of constituencies did not reflect the demographics of Bahrain. They maintained that the proposals for a system with one or five constituencies would reduce existing inconsistencies and provide greater opportunity for women and minority groups to be represented. Others defended the current arrangement, noting that smaller constituencies allow MPs better familiarity with their community. They feared that reducing the number of constituencies would create sectarian quotas in parliament, leading to political crisis.

Page 5, C. Social
3.  Women, children and persons with special needs
The National Dialogue recognised the importance of protecting the rights of women, children and persons with special needs. A decision to bolster women’s rights will ensure their greater protection from violence, equal rights in the workplace and greater political and economic empowerment, including reviewing women’s salary levels in the private sector. In particular, Bahrain will ensure the comprehensive implementation of the UN Convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women while respecting the country’s religious tradition. On children’s rights, delegates called for all relevant legislation to be fully implemented, and to restrict the participation of children in rallies and demonstrations. People with special needs will be granted better access to education and specialised bodies through the adoption of a National Strategy on the rights of people with special needs in September 2011. Delegates called for improved coordination between the government and civil society organisations protecting the rights of people with special needs.

Page 6, 5. Naturalised citizens
Consensus was reached on the proposal that the children of Bahraini women married to foreign nationals would be granted Bahraini citizenship according to a clear set of rules. Delegates agreed to develop rules to prohibit discrimination against naturalised citizens. Naturalised citizens will be entitled to stand for elections 5 years after having obtained their Bahraini passport on the condition that they are not dual nationals."

Ten years ago today at the Petersberg, Afghanistan charted a new path towards a sovereign, peaceful, prosperous and democratic future, and the International Community accepted the responsibility to help Afghanistan along that path. Together we have achieved substantial progress over these ten years, more than in any other period in Afghanistan’s history. Never before have the Afghan people, and especially Afghan women,	enjoyed comparable access to services, including education and health, or seen greater development of infrastructure across the country. Al Qaida has been disrupted, and Afghanistan’s national security institutions are increasingly able to assume	 responsibility for a secure and independent Afghanistan.	

Page 2, Governance, 6
Afghanistan reaffirms that the future of its political system will continue to reflect its pluralistic society and remain firmly founded on the Afghan Constitution. The Afghan people will continue to build a stable, democratic society, based on the rule of law, where the human rights and fundamental freedoms of its citizens, including the equality of men and women, are guaranteed under the Constitution. Afghanistan recommits to upholding all of its international human rights obligations.

We have taken note of statements by Afghan civil society organisations, including today’s statements by two of their delegates at this meeting. We all reaffirm that the human rights and fundamental freedoms enshrined in the Afghan Constitution, including the rights of women and children, as well as a thriving and free civil society are key for Afghanistan’s future. Therefore, we underscore the further promotion of civil society participation, including both traditional civil society structures and modern manifestations of civic action, including the role of youth, in the country’s democratic processes.

Mindful of the relevant UN resolutions, the International Community concurs with Afghanistan that the peace and reconciliation process and its outcome must be based on the following principles:
(a) The process leading to reconciliation must be: truly Afghan‐led and Afghan‐owned; as well as inclusive, representing the legitimate interests of all the people of Afghanistan, regardless of gender or social status.
(b) Reconciliation must contain: the reaffirmation of a sovereign, stable and united Afghanistan; the renunciation of violence; the breaking of ties to international terrorism; respect for the Afghan Constitution, including its human rights provisions, notably the rights of women.
(c) The region must respect and support the peace process and its outcome."

3. Given the need to make the CNT the main body for inclusive management of the transition, and to meet the conditions for greater participation in the drafting of constitutional and legislative texts, essential to the legislative process and to the restoration of the constitutional order, the composition of the CNT should be reviewed. Given the need to ensure the stability of the functioning of this body, as well as achieving a better balance in the composition of the CNT, it is recommended that:

- The number of seats in the CNT is increased to a total of 135;
- That the new 30 seats be allocated to the regions of the country, to political parties including the former presidential majority, who are currently under-represented, to the politico-military groups which have not yet given up the fight, as well as to civil society and women."

First, the Commission shall contribute to the elucidation of what has happened, in accordance with the elements of the mandate described here below, and to offer a broad explanation about the complexity of the conflict, so as to promote a shared understanding among the society, in particular about the least known aspects of the conflict. In this sense, we welcome the visit and the pronouncement made during this cycle by Zainab Bangura, Special Representative of the Secretary General of the United Nations on Sexual Violence in Conflicts, and we undertake to attend to her recommendations.

Page 1-2, Purposes of the Commission:
And third, the Commission shall promote coexistence in the territories. For that purpose, it will foster an environment of dialogue and will create spaces for restoring the dignity of the victims, for individual and collective acknowledgments of responsibility, and, in general, to consolidate citizen respect for and trust in each other, cooperation and solidarity, social justice, gender equity, and a democratic culture that fosters tolerance and rids us from indifference toward the problems of others. In this manner, the foundations will be set for non-repetition, reconciliation, and the construction of a stable and long lasting peace. For those reasons, it is necessary to understand the construction of truth as an essential element for building peace. The success of the Commission will depend on the commitment of all sectors of society with the process for the construction of truth, and on the recognition of responsibilities by those who directly or indirectly took part in the conﬂict. That is why both the National Government and the FARC – EP commit to decisively contribute toward the elucidation of the truth about everything that has happened in the conﬂict, including serious human rights violations and infringements upon International Humanitarian Law (IHL).

Page 5, Commission for the Elucidation of Truth, Coexistence, and Non-Repetition, Duties
In order to fulfil its mandate, the Commission shall have the following main duties:
...
Ensure the cross-cutting nature of the gender approach throughout the entire scope of the work of the Commission, by creating a gender task force in charge of contributing with the tasks for preparing specific technical, research, and gender audiences, among others. This task force will not be the only one addressing the topic, but it should bear the responsibility for reviewing the methodologies in order to ensure that all the Commission’s instruments include a gender approach, and for coordination purposes with women’s and LGBTI organizations. The foregoing, without prejudice to the necessary autonomy of the Commission in determining its structure and working methodology.

Page 6, Commission for the Elucidation of Truth, Coexistence, and Non-Repetition, Selection process

Page 3, Untitled Preamble: 
The armed conflict, which has multiple causes, has caused suffering and harm to the population unparalleled in our history. Millions of Colombian men and women are victims of forced displacement, there have been hundreds of thousands of deaths, tens of thousands of missing persons of all kinds and a large number of collectives and affected populations throughout the length and width of the territory, including peasant communities, indigenous, Afro-Colombian, black, palenquero, raizal, and Rom, political parties, social and trade union movements, guilds economic, among others. Without forgetting other forms of less visible but no less painful victimization, such as sexual violence, psychological effects, or even the presence of fear.

Page 5, 5.1. Comprehensive System for Truth, Justice, Reparation and Non-Repetition: 
The Comprehensive System has a differentiated and gender-based approach, which is designed to respond to the particular characteristics of victimization in each territory and each population, and in particular to the needs of women and children.

Page 5-6, 5.1. Comprehensive System for Truth, Justice, Reparation and Non-Repetition, Goals:
In summary, the different measures and mechanisms of the Comprehensive System should contribute to the fulfillment of the following purposes: 
. . . 
Territorial, differentiated and gender-based approach, through the differentiated treatment of territories and populations, in particular of women and boy and girl victims, and of the most deprived and most vulnerable populations and collective groups, that are most affected by the conflict.

Page 8, 5.1.1.1 Commission for the Clarification of Truth, Coexistence and Non-Repetition:
The Commission must fulfill three fundamental objectives, which as a whole contribute to the non-Repetition of the conflict:
In the first place, the Commission shall contribute to the clarification of what happened, in accordance with the elements of the mandate as described later, and offer a substantive explanation of the complexity of the conflict, in such a way as to promote a shared understanding in society, in particular of the least-known aspects of the conflict, as the impact of the conflict on children and adolescents and gender-based violence, among other matters.

Page 9, 5.1.1.1 Commission for the Clarification of Truth, Coexistence and Non-Repetition: 
And thirdly, the Commission should promote coexistence in the territories, in the understanding that coexistence is not a matter of simple sharing of the same social and political space, but involves the creation of an environment that allows the transformative peaceful resolution of conflicts and the construction of the broadest culture of respect and tolerance in democracy. This will promote an atmosphere of dialogue and create spaces in which the dignity of victims will be restored, individual and collective recognition of responsibility will take place, and in general the respect and confidence of citizens in each other, cooperation and solidarity, social justice, gender equity, and a democratic culture that fosters tolerance, promotes the good life, free us from indifference to the problems of others, will be consolidated. The Commission shall contribute to the construction of a peace based on the truth, the knowledge and recognition of a bloody past that must be overcome. 
…
The Commission will develop an appropriate differential and gender approach that allows evidencing the differential forms in which the conflict affected women, children, adolescents, young people and older adults, to persons in situations of disability, to indigenous peoples, to peasant communities, to Afro-Colombian, black, palenquero and raizal populations, to the population LGBTI, to displaced persons and exiled, the [women and men] defenders of human rights, trade unionists, journalists, and women and men farmers, traders and businessmen/women, among others. This should also contribute to the Colombian society's understanding of the specific ways in which the conflict reproduced historical mechanisms of discrimination and gender stereotypes, as a critical first step to having a more just and inclusive society.

Page 10, 5.1.1.1 Commission for the Clarification of Truth, Coexistence and Non-Repetition, 5.1.1.1.1 Guiding Criteria: 
. . . 
Differential and gender approach: in the development of its mandate and functions, the Commission will take into account the different experiences, differential impact and particular conditions of persons by reason of sex, gender, age, ethnicity or disability situation, and of the populations or sectors in conditions of vulnerability or especially affected by the conflict, among others. There will be special attention to the victimization suffered by women.

Page 12, 5.1.1.1 Commission for the Clarification of Truth, Coexistence and Non-Repetition, 5.1.1.1.2. Mandate:
… 
The mandate of the Commission will include to clarify and promote the recognition of:

We, the parties to this Declaration are: development/cultural associations, Traditional Councils, youth, women, religious and respected opinion leaders and elders brought together by the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue (HD), with our consent, because of our history of Inter-communal, farmer and grazer and religious violence. Southern Kaduna has had a number of experiences of violent conflict that constitute a major threat to peace and security. Electoral disputes, farmer and grazer differences in particular, have caused violence, deaths, injuries, loss of property, trauma, widows and orphans, poverty and massive displacements. The stakeholders in this Declaration are convinced that a necessary condition for establishing lasting peace in our State is the resort to dialogue to resolve conflicts.

Page 4, Section I, Article ii 
Note that the conflicts in Kaduna have nevertheless left their mark on the whole society but specifically affect vulnerable groups including women, children, youths and persons with disability more and stress the need to provide adequate support for them to rebuild their lives.

Page 8, Section V, Article i 
i.	Conflict prevention plan: The plan will bring on board the joint efforts of all stakeholders including at the State level, traditional and faith based leaders, women and youth that puts in place a tension management mechanism that;
•	Creates a linkage between early warning and early response.
•	Ensure continuous monitoring of violent conflict situations.
•	Intervene in conflict situations and pursue such measures as are necessary to arrest and redress the situation.
•	Make appropriate recommendations for action by law enforcement agencies.
•	Provide broad civic education on rights, obligations and cohesion as well as religious studies.
•	Teach conflict prevention and conflict transformation skills to young people.
Undertake bilateral consultations and advocacy with political leaders to reinforce messages, identify areas of mutual concern and agreement.

Page 8, Section V, Article iv 
Begin and sustain tracks of dialogues among key non-political stakeholders such as business leaders, women’s organizations and civil society organizations to influence and facilitate discussions between political actors.

Page 9, Section V, Article v 
Inclusion of women and youths, persons with disability in decision- making and peace processes: On many occasions, reconciliation and dialogue efforts exclude meaningful participation of women and youth. This exclusion causes disenchantment and negative perception of the outcomes of reconciliation efforts.

Page 9, Section VII, Article i d 
Create a body to promote peace and reconciliation amongst communities that will:
•	Bring perpetrators to justice, inclusive of both indigenes and settlers.
•	Consider the compensation of all affected people.
•	Address past wrongs drawing on the wisdom and expertise of traditional conflict resolution mechanisms.
•	Ensure the inclusion and active participation of women, youths and persons with disability in all peace processes.
•	Prevent and protect women against violence.
•	Advance and protect human rights, administrative justice and integrity in private and public life.
•	Foster respect for the rule of law, transparency and accountability.

These measures should also contribute to ensuring the effective administration of justice in cases of gender violence, free of gender-based stereotypes or sexual orientation, and with sanctions proportional to the gravity of the offense.
[...]
6.	Gender -based Approach: Special emphasis will be placed on the protection of women, children, and adolescents who have been affected by criminal organisations targeted by Agreement. This approach will take into account the specific risks faced by women against their life, freedom, integrity, and security, and will be appropriate to such risks.
[...]
10.	Guarantee  of non-repetition: The State will take measures to ensure clarification of the paramilitary phenomenon, to prevent its repetition and ensure the dismantling of criminal organisations responsible for killings, massacres, and systematic gender-based violence, or that infringe on human rights defenders, social movements or political movements, including the criminal organisations that have been named successors to paramilitary groups and their support networks, and the prosecution of criminal behaviour that threatens the implementation of the agreements and the building of peace.

Page 15, 3.4.9 Mechanism for prevention and monitoring of criminal organisations targeted by this agreement:
In accordance with that established in the ""Political Participation Agreement’” in point 2.1.2.1 (b), a new prevention and early warning system for rapid reaction to the presence, operations and/or activities of the organisations and criminal behaviour targeted by this Agreement will be created in the Ombudsman Office, coordinated with the National Government and the Special Investigation Unit, and in whose design will participate the National Security Assurances Commission. The system should combine permanent monitoring and early warning activities with the ability to react rapidly and deploy in the field. It will act in coordination with the organisations for the defence of human rights and the communities. This system will give early warnings autonomously without having to consult with or submit their decisions to any other institution.
This Early Warning System must have a territorial, differential, and gender-based approach and a preventive security deployment, without detriment to its national deployment and its capacity to react. The Colombian State will ensure adequate financing according to the specific requirements of the system and its comprehensive functioning."

Based on sustained talks and the respectful and cordial exchange of points and opinions, we conclude that the FARC-EP, using its autonomy and competencies, as one of the parties to the dialogue, will bring the following points before the National Government for analysis and possible incorporation into the Agreement:

1. A wording that defines the interpretation with relation to the ""gender approach"" which will make clear the understanding that it refers to the special claim and protection of the rights of women as the main victim of the conflict and as an essential protagonist in the construction of peace post-conflict.

2. That the ""gender approach"" of the Agreements will be understood in such a way as to subsequently permit, whether for public or private purposes, unequivocal interpretations which respect the concept of the family written clearly in Article 42 of the Political Constitution."

Page 34, 2. Political participation: A democratic opportunity to build peace, Preamble
Taking account of the fact that women face greater social and institutional barriers in terms of political participation, as a result of deep-rooted discrimination and inequality, as well as structural conditions of exclusion and subordination, there will be significant challenges in guaranteeing their right to participation, and facing up to and transforming these historical conditions will involve developing affirmative measures that will safeguard women's participation in the various areas of political and social representation. To that end, the situation and condition of women in all contexts and in all special aspects will have to be acknowledged.

Page 35, 2. Political participation: A democratic opportunity to build peace, Preamble 
The National Government and the FARC-EP recognise that:
In consolidating citizen participation on the part of women, their social agendas have to be appreciated and their contribution to public life as political subjects has to be recognised, especially in the area of the promotion and defence of their rights.
… The promotion not only of political pluralism but also social movements and organisations, particularly of women, young people and other sectors excluded from the exercise of politics and, in general, the democratic debate, requires new forums for dissemination in order that parties, organisations and communities involved in peacebuilding can gain access to space on national, regional and local channels and broadcasters.

…In addition, the following political groups representing the opposition will be called to take part in the Commission: the Marcha Patriótica political movement and the Congreso de los Pueblos political movement, and also two experts delegated by the FARC-EP.

…
That these phenomena have a severe influence on specific forms of violence that particularly affect women, victims of human trafficking, sexual exploitation and violence resulting from the use of illicit drugs, among others, which requires the training of women in the planning and monitoring of action to combat this kind of violence.
